<p style='text-align: justify;'>I'm a PhD student working with Prof. Jimeng Sun in <a href="http://www.sunlab.org/">SunLab</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. My main research interest is statistical machine learning (ML). My current research focuses on developing deep learning algorithms learning from large scale multimodal clinical  data and generating precise predictions, which enables health care professionals to make data-driven decisions.
