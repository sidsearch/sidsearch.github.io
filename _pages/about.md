<p style='text-align: justify;'>I'm a PhD student working with Prof. Jimeng Sun in <a href="http://www.sunlab.org/">SunLab</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. My main research interest is statistical machine learning (ML). My current research focuses on developing cutting-edge ML algorithms learning from large scale clinical time series data and generating precise predictions at an individual (patient) level, which enables health care professionals to make data-driven decisions. My research topics include but are not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling.
